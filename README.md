The WikipedediaHTMLExtractor is a programm that is designed to transform into csv files all the data contained in the 
various wikitable objects from any Wikipedia page.

To use it, you just need to import the project into your IDE, and run the App.class. If you want to extract a specific 
URL, just comment the for loop, uncomment the three final lines, and replace the current URL with your ownâ€™s. In any 
case, provided all goes well, you fill find your csv files (one file per wikitable) in the directory named output/html.
